# 100 Days Of ML Code

100 Days of Machine Learning Code. Full instructions about the challenge [here](https://github.com/3lv27/100DaysOfMLCode/blob/master/100_Days_of_ML_Code_Instructions.md)

My intention is to divide the challenge in 50 days specifically dedicated to the field of Deep Learning, since they are the days left for the presentation of the Saturdays.ai course project.


### Day 0: March 30, 2019
##### (DL - Drone madness)

**Today's Progress**: Defined our DL based project. As a brief intro our main goal is to build a self autonomous flight drone which would be able to map an indoor space and also be able to find a person in that space. 

**Thoughts:** It is a very ambicious project based on the deadline we have but we are full of willing and very excited to see how far we can go. I still have some researchs to do about the object detection, but I expect to have this solved by tomorrow.

### Day 1: March 31, 2019
##### (DL - Drone madness)

**Today's Progress**: Researched about a bunch of computer object detection models. Cleared on my mind the difference between RCNN, Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN, YOLO and RetinaNet. I tried to implement RetinaNet with PyTorch but finally I found and implementation with Keras which is working right. Builded Collab filtering model following lesson 4 notebook from Fast.ai course and watched again lesson 5.

**Thoughts:** I spent a few hours reading about object detection models and realized how it is like a new enetirely world inside DL itself, there's still too much stuff to learn. Thinking about it would be super nice to implement RetinaNet inside Fast.ai library. Maybe after I finished the project it is something that I'm willing to do.

## Day 2: April 1, 2019
##### (DL - Drone madness)

**Today's Progress**: Builded a NN from scratch (notebook 5 from lesson 5 of fast.ai course). Started to read PyTorch tutorial and finally hands oh the drone project! Started to understand the sdk from our drone Dji Tello and also started to build the space recognition protocol.

**Thoughts:** First day of this log combined with my work journey. The only thing I can say is its gonna be hard as f***! Is almost 12am o'clock and I still have a bunch of things to do
