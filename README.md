# 100 Days Of ML Code

100 Days of Machine Learning Code. Full instructions about the challenge

My intention is to divide the challenge in 50 days specifically dedicated to the field of Deep Learning, since they are the days left for the presentation of the Saturdays.ai course project.


### Day 0: March 30, 2019
##### (DL - Drone madness)

**Today's Progress**: Defined our DL based project. As a brief intro our main goal is to build a self autonomous flight drone which would be able to map an indoor space and also be able to find a person in that space. 

**Thoughts:** It is a very ambicious project based on the deadline we have but we are full of willing and very excited to see how far we can go. I still have some researchs to do about the object detection, but I expect to have this solved by tomorrow.
